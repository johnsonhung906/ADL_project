Most of the time, when they travel, they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide, who usually takes care of everything, for instance, choosing the restaurants, the itinerary, the mode of transport, and things like that. Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged, around 40 to 50 or so. This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels, and have money to spend.

They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything.", "I don't mean to interrupt, but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market?", "Just a moment.

But according to our record, your annual turnover is not too big, so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency.", "If that's the case, we can talk about it first. What's your concept of a big amount?", "I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least.", "I'm afraid that's too much for us.", "We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us.

At the beginning of our campaign, there is sales resistance to overcome, we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs. A 20 % commission will not leave us much.", "Our price is worked out according to the costing. A 20 % commission means an increase in our price.

They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located, or even in a third country.", "I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade. It's a reciprocal business, isn't it?", "Yes, you are right. Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly, but they can enter into an agreement.

You're inspecting the factory in the morning and having dinner with him in the evening.", "I've got a schedule!", "Oh, that's not everything.

We're expecting a delivery on Friday. We've only got ten in stock at the moment. I can deliver those by first thing tomorrow morning. There'll be an extra charge for special delivery. I'll have to send them by courier."]}

Why, what's the problem?", "I'm not sure but there seems to be something wrong with it. Is it still under guarantee?", "I think the guarantee's just run out. Let me check. Oh, it's OK. We took out an extended warranty, it runs until next March."]}
{"id": 331, "dialog": ["Bad news, I'm afraid. Our supplier has gone bust. The parts you ordered have arrived at the docks but the handling agent won't release them until someone pays the invoice. We also need to arrange transport to the factory.", "Don't worry about the cost. Our insurance policy covers us against situations like this. We need those parts urgently. Could you please try to get them here tomorrow?"]}
{"id": 332, "dialog": ["Why have you changed your job so frequently?", "My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear. I do not have more chances to enrich my experience. Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up, but unfortunately, they closed their service in three months ' time. I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now, but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution."]}
{"id": 333, "dialog": ["Today I want to invite you to talk about insurance you're interested in.", "Thank you. I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance.", "Of course. A two-week paid vacation a year, a five-day workweek.", "Good. Anything else?", "Yes, all the insurance will be linked with your work. We will issue an insurance policy."]}

Then, you have a lunch appointment with Mr. Li. And this afternoon at four you will attend a press conference.", "I am afraid I can't attend the press conference due to an urgent conference with the Board of Directors at half past four.", "All right. Do you want me to cancel the reservation for you?", "Yes, thank you very much. In addition, do you have the marketing proposal ready?", "The proposal is being repaired right now and I think it will be ready by tomorrow morning."]}

If I'm sick an extra day or two, will my pay be deducted?", "Yes. That's the company policy.", "It was the same as the last place I worked at. I was hoping you'd be different."]}
{"id": 336, "dialog": ["Do you have some questions?", "Yes, I really want to know about the housing system in your company.", "If you join us, our company will provide you a single dormitory. If you make great achievements, our company will offer you a flat according to the related regulations. It all depends.", "I also want to know if there's a holiday at your company, for I must visit my parents every year.", "Besides the official holidays, our company offers a ten days paid holiday every year, which makes it possible for you to visit your parents. Any other questions?", "No, thanks."]}
{"id": 337, "dialog": ["This is the schedule for the project. Any comments or questions?", "I think we'll need more time than the schedule gives us.", "Don't worry. These dates are only targets."]}

Besides, I would like to practise my English in my work. As my present employer deals with China trade towards China only, there isn't much chance to speak English."]}
{"id": 339, "dialog": ["You have worked in your present company for five years.", "Yes, I do.", "Why do you want to resign?", "As you know I serve as a secretary in my present company, I really want to look for a more challenging opportunity.", "What kind of work are you interested in?", "Just as you advertised in the newspaper.", "So you are interested in our company.", "Yes, what's more, your company is one of the largest and best trading companies in this line of business."]}
{"id": 340, "dialog": ["Hi, Paulo. How are things going?", "Everything's going very well. The first phase of the project was finished three days ahead of schedule. We're on target to complete phase two by the beginning of week 40.", "That's good news. What stage are you at now?", "Well, we've just finished laying the cabling and we're waiting for the safety inspector to give us the go-ahead to continue. I'm just going to meet him. Do you want to come?"]}
{"id": 341, "dialog": ["We're going to have to postpone the meeting.", "Why?", "Mr. Chen can't make it today."]}
{"id": 342, "dialog": ["Our new production control program's going live on Monday. The old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks. That should give us time to iron out any little problems.", "Hope it all goes well. We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year.", "Yes, I realise that. We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over. I'm confident we won't have any major problems."]}
{"id": 343, "dialog": ["Is the new computerised stock system in operation?", "Not quite. The software engineers are testing it just now.", "Have all the operators been trained on it?", "Yes, most of them. We trained on a dummy system last month. A couple of people were away so we've organised two more training sessions on the live system for the whole team this week."]}
{"id": 344, "dialog": ["We need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade. But don't worry, it won't cause too much inconvenience. We're going to do it over the weekend.", "How long will the system be down for?", "We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time. It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours. If everything goes according to plan, it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday.", "That's fine. We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side."]}
{"id": 345, "dialog": ["How many places have you worked altogether?", "Three.", "Would you tell me the general description of your present job?", "I am in charge of the trading department.

It's not part of my job.", "What made you decide to change your job?", "I am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible, so I decided to change my job. I'd like to find a job which is more challenging."]}
{"id": 346, "dialog": ["Hi! Someone has reported a fault on one of your copiers.", "That's right. I'm glad you're here. It hasn't been working properly for the last few days.", "When was it serviced?", "Just a couple of weeks ago. It's usually very reliable.", "What's actually wrong with it?", "Well, it's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays.", "I'm sure it's nothing serious, probably just a minor fault. I'll have a look at it."]}
{"id": 347, "dialog": ["I've just got a new printer. How often do I need to replace the print heads?", "Well, under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 copies or so. It depends on the user, but about once a month is average.", "So if I don't print out very much, it could last a lot longer?", "That's right. It could last six months or more. This model's designed for heavy use. Don't worry - you'll get an error message telling you when to change the head."]}
{"id": 348, "dialog": ["We've got very good workshop facilities here. We do all our own servicing and most repairs. We have separate areas for welding, grinding and sawing.", "Is there anything you don't do in-house?", "Yes. If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here, we send it out for maintenance.", "Is that more expensive?", "It depends on the job. It's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often."]}
{"id": 349, "dialog": ["Are you doing the job the way I suggested?", "No, I think I didn't like your method.", "Well, have it your way."]}
{"id": 350, "dialog": ["Can you help me? This fitting has come loose and I need something to tighten it up.", "Let's have a look. Oh yes, you need a 10 mm ring spanner. Here you are. Just leave it on the workbench when you finish.", "Thanks for your help.", "No problem."]}

Have you got any light bulbs?", "They're in the blue cupboard. Anything else?", "Oh yes, some wire cutters.", "I'll need to check. Sorry, we don't have any in stock. But I can order some and send through the order today. How many do you need?", "Just one pair.", "Fine. They should be here the day after tomorrow."]}
{"id": 352, "dialog": ["I haven't seen this machine before. What's it used for?", "It's a really useful piece of equipment. It's for smoothing rough edges. Here let me show you how it works. It's very simple to operate."]}
{"id": 353, "dialog": ["Could you type up this document for me, Sandra?", "Sure, but I have to finish this report first.", "Never mind. I'll do it."]}
{"id": 354, "dialog": ["I've just taken a spanner set from the stores.", "That's fine. Don't forget to update the inventory.", "Sorry, what do you mean?", "When you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to reorder."]}
{"id": 355, "dialog": ["Hi, Sven, can you help me? Could you hold the end of the tape measure, please?", "Of course, where do you want me to stand?", "Just there by the door. I need to measure the length of this workbench. We're going to replace it. OK - 3 m 47 cm. Let's round it up to 3 m 50.", "I'm glad you're replacing it. We need more space to work on things. How deep will the new workbench be?", "Tell me what size you want and I'll order the wood.", "Well, it's about 65 cm at the moment. Could we increase it by about a third?", "Sure. So let's see. We need a piece of wood 3.5 m long by 1 m wide. I'll order it right away and I'll be able to install it next Tuesday."]}
{"id": 356, "dialog": ["Has my package arrived?", "I'm not sure. What does it look like?", "It's quite a delicate piece of equipment, so I hope it was well-packed. It's oblong-shaped, about 50 cm long. It's made of metal.", "There's a large wooden crate in the corner which I haven't unpacked yet. It might be in there."]}
{"id": 357, "dialog": ["OK, so this is the main factory area. We're now walking past the printing machine. It's printing in four colours at the moment.", "What's going on over there?", "They're setting up the machine for a new run.", "How long does that usually take?", "About twenty minutes.", "What's happening at the far end?", "That's the packing line. The goods are being wrapped and loaded onto pallets ready for transportation."]}

{"id": 359, "dialog": ["Would you like me to show you our new cleaning unit? It's a clever design.", "Yes, I'd like to see that. What does it clean exactly?", "It washes the solvent off all the metal parts - the blades, trays etc. - and then sends it back into the system.", "What does the unit consist of?", "Well, it's basically two tanks \u2013 one for the dirty solvent and one for the clean solvent, a pump and a washing unit. Oh, and there's a cooling system and a filter. It's all controlled by a PLC system \u2013 that stands for Process Logic Control."]}
{"id": 360, "dialog": ["Good morning, everybody. Welcome to IAM Technology. I'm very pleased so many of you could make it here today. My name's Sam Weiss. I'm the Production Manager. I'd like to show you the layout of the factory before we go and visit it. As you can see from this diagram, everything is under one roof. We've designed it this way to help the flow of materials and to avoid bottlenecks.", "This area here is where we keep our raw materials. The main production area - our machine hall - is situated next to it. Maintenance is situated between the stores and the production area. Just to the right of Maintenance, there are steps up to the Lab and the Admin Section. Process Control is also on the upper level. It's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below."]}
{"id": 361, "dialog": ["OK, so this is our newest machine. It was only installed last year.", "What's the running speed of the machine?", "About 1,500 metres per minute. It's one of the fastest in the world. We had a few problems with it after start-up but it's running very well now.", "And what's the maximum output?", "If we're running at full capacity, it's 160,000 tonnes per annum."]}
{"id": 362, "dialog": ["Is the factory fully-automated?", "Not completely. Our production process is partially-automated. We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually.", "What about supply of parts to the production line?", "Well, the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system. And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line.", "What about the smaller components?", "They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory."]}
{"id": 363, "dialog": ["Could you explain the paper-making process to us - in very simple terms - please?", "Well, the pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine, which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it, where most of the water is extracted.", "So, is it actually paper at this stage?", "Yes, it is. But we need to take out more water. So it then passes through a series of rollers, where more water is squeezed out. After that it goes through the dryers, which are at a very high temperature. The paper is then coated. And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths."]}
{"id": 364, "dialog": ["How do you dispose of the waste in your factory?", "We try to recycle as much as we can.", "What about the rest? How do you get rid of it?", "We have to send it to landfill. It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste.", "But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide?", "Yes, you're right, it does. But we believe it's less harmful to the environment than landfill"]}
{"id": 365, "dialog": ["Has your company been affected much by government legislation?", "Yes, we have. We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards.", "What about your use of raw materials?", "Well, we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we're not allowed to use lead in our products any more.", "What happens if you exceed the limits?", "We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine."]}
{"id": 366, "dialog": ["Hello, ABC Company.", "Hello, could I speak to Mr. Wang, please?", "I am sorry. He's out in a meeting now. Could I ask who is calling?", "This is Mr. Smith of XYZ Company.

{"id": 369, "dialog": ["Good morning, Mr. Smith. Welcome to Wuhan.", "Good morning!", "Mr. Smith, did you have a good journey?", "I just feel a little tired. You know, it took me 16 hours to get here.", "You must take a rest today.", "That's very kind of you, but I can do without a rest. I have long wanted to have a talk with you about the possibility of business between us.", "We welcome good business. Anyhow, we know you must get tired by the flight, so we arrange a meeting tomorrow. Today you can have a good rest.", "Thank you very much.", "We hope your stay here a pleasant one!", "I believe I will."]}
{"id": 370, "dialog": ["Good afternoon.", "Hello. This is Jones. I'd like to speak to Mr. Chen.", "Speaking.", "I'd like to discuss the new order with you. Would you like to have lunch together at Garden Hotel next Tuesday?", "Let me check my diary. Er. I'm afraid I can't make Tuesday. I've got to go to Beijing for a conference. I'll come back on Thursday.", "That's a pity. Does Friday suit you?", "Yeah, that would be fine. What time?", "Is 12 o'clock convenient for you?", "Yeah, that's fine. Next Friday at 12 at Garden Hotel. I'll look forward to it."]}

And I think you must be very tired.", "Yes, I am, rather. But I'll be all right by tomorrow and ready for business.", "I wish you a pleasant stay here.", "Thank you.", "Now, Mr. Smith, if all is ready, we'd better start for the hotel.", "I'd like to. Let's go.", "This way, please. Our car is waiting over there."]}

Here's the minutes of the meeting.", "How long did the meeting last?", "The meeting was delayed by thirty minutes and it lasted for two and a half hours.", "Did the chairman ask for me?", "Yes, I told him that you were very ill and couldn't attend.", "All right. Have you handed in my report to him?", "Yes, I did. Besides, here are all the reports and materials handed out in the meeting. I think you'll have to do some replies.", "Thank you, Anne. You've done an excellent job. Did they mention the date for the next meeting?", "No, they didn't. The chairman said he would send a memo to all managers by the end of this week informing them of the date of the next meeting."]}
{"id": 373, "dialog": ["Hi, Mary, you have been a secretary for several years in this company. Could you tell me what a secretary should do for a meeting or a conference?", "Well, an important part of the duties of a secretary, I think, is to do well the preparation work for the meeting.", "What should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting? Can you tell me a bit more about it?", "First of all, the agenda should be prepared before the meeting. Then you should ensure that those entitled to be present are properly informed.", "I see, and how about the documents and the information?", "All the necessary documents and the information relevant to the meeting should be available, preferably printed and distributed before the meeting.", "And what should a secretary do during the meeting?", "Of course, she should take minutes.", "And after the meeting?", "After the meeting she should type the minutes up, and then keep proper records of the business transacted and the resolutions passed and also implement many of the decision reached at the meeting.", "It's seriously good."]}

We can go into details later.", "Thank you.", "Our speciality back in South Africa is wholesale supplying of screws, bolts, nuts, pins, studs, and that kind of things.", "For wood or for metal?", "For both.

Anything else?", "Yes, you'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer, and then send those materials to each business worker.", "OK, I'll do it right now.", "By the way, to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us. Because I found a biggest opponent from this post-trip.", "Yes, I get it.", "OK, it's no anything. Do what you should do."]}

{"id": 380, "dialog": ["You say your products are aimed at the green consumer. In what ways are they environmentally-friendly?", "We produce household cleaning products - detergents and so on. They are all phosphate-free, which minimises damage to the environment.", "What about the packaging?", "We try to use as little packaging as possible. Also, all our bottles are made of recyclable plastic and we use recycled fibre in our boxes. That's what our customers want."]}
{"id": 381, "dialog": ["Your hand is bleeding. What have you done to it?", "I cut it on that blade.", "I'll get the first aid box. There's some antiseptic cream and a bandage in there."]}
{"id": 382, "dialog": ["What sort of problems do you have with these machines?", "They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components. We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion. We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down. It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary. There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line. If it gets wet, it might rot so we check that regularly too."]}
{"id": 383, "dialog": ["Hi, Xavier. I'd like to go over the list of jobs for next week's maintenance shut.", "Sure. We've got a lot to do in a short time. We're planning to shut the line at midday on Wednesday and start up again at 6 pm the following day. We might need to extend the shut by about six hours.", "Our production people won't be happy about that. We've got a full order book at the moment. Is there any way you could speed things up?", "Not really. We need to dismantle the conveyor belt and replace the rollers."]}
{"id": 384, "dialog": ["Recycling is big business these days, isn't it?", "Yes, it's definitely a growing business.", "What do you recycle in your plant?", "Mainly plastics. Plastics aren't bio degradable - they don't break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away.", "How is plastic recycled, then?", "Well, there are basically two methods. One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles. These can then be used in the production of new chemicals.", "Is that the method you use here?", "No, we don't do that here. We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products.", "How do you do that?", "By melting it down and then reforming it. Our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets."]}

Could you then print these for me?", "Sure, just send me through internal mail.", "Thanks, Vivian.", "No problem at all. Welcome."]}
{"id": 1283, "dialog": ["Hi, still in the office? It's already 7.", "I would like to go but I have to finish a very important presentation. Our boss needs it for tomorrow's morning meeting and I was given the complete information only late this afternoon.", "Sounds like our boss. Typically him always late with important information. Anything I can help?", "Oh, that will be great. Thank you so much. Please help me to double-check the name list. I have to make sure they are all correct.", "Ok, shall I make a coffee first?", "Not for me. It is already late. I can not fall asleep after drinking coffee this late."]}
{"id": 1284, "dialog": ["Hi, Francis, morning! How are you doing today?", "I had a bad start of the day. I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting.", "Indeed, I agree that is not a good start. How about the meeting? You missed anything important?", "It is ok. My boss briefs me later on.", "Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting?", "Err, kind of. You know this traffic jam is really bad with so many new cars hitting the streets these days."]}
{"id": 1285, "dialog": ["Did you punch in?", "Yes. By the way, you are having a great make-up today. I like the color of your lipstick. So adorable!", "Really? It took me really a while to find the color. I am happy you like it.", "Well, girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things. Actually, do we still have a meeting this afternoon?", "Sure, when those never ending meetings."]}
{"id": 1286, "dialog": ["Hello, Mr. Thomas. Could you spare a minute?", "What do you need?", "I need to talk to you about that new driver you'Ve hired. I think I am going to have some problems working with him.", "He seems to be quite qualified. If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves."]}
{"id": 1287, "dialog": ["Look, here is a very special business card from an illustrator. Every time I go through my book of business cards, I will notice it. It is an eye-catching one.", "Wow, fantastic. I like the font and color for his name. It is creative yet personal.", "Yes, it is a bold design. People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card. It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations.", "I agree. Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business. It won't take much time to design an amazing card, but it can make a big difference among the crowd. And you'll always notice it from your collection. For they have outspoken colors, own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card. I wish to have one like this. But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow."]}
{"id": 1288, "dialog": ["Congratulations! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter.", "Thank you. I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new. You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast.", "Sure it is. This is a changing world. Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month? They are very useful for us.", "Yes, according to the agenda, there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course.", "Well, good for you. I hope you can get what you want from the training.", "I will do my best."]}
{"id": 1289, "dialog": ["What's the problem? Things are getting out of hand. You keep sticking your nose where it doesn't belong.", "What do you mean?", "Now, I am responsible for training new staff, but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods. I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove. But I don't like your way."]}
{"id": 1290, "dialog": ["What is your most preferred training method?", "Well, I prefer active rather than passive training. For example, I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin. They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice. All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room, so we could communicate with each other. We had a lot of fun learning together. It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues.", "Well, that is also very efficient, right?", "Of course, it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet.", "That's boring. Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches, all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video."]}
{"id": 1291, "dialog": ["Have you heard that we will have reorganization?", "No, really?", "Yes, flexible, aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department.", "Who will be there?", "James is going to be packed off there.", "That is good. He can leave you alone this time."]}

I feel overwhelmed by the daily work. Sometimes, I just can't focus on what I am doing. What is worse, though I make plans for a whole week, I always have to make changes later on because other things come up. I can't manage my time well. I can't handle work well. I am afraid I was screw up more things.", "Look, Lucy. Things are not so bad as you said. This is our company's busiest time in a year. You need to relax a little. Don't push yourself too hard, ok?", "Well, I will try."]}
{"id": 1293, "dialog": ["How do you think a manager should react to an employee's unsatisfactory work?", "If I were a manager, I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons. It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction.", "Exactly, I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning, they were from the company on the 12th floor, I guess. They were only three of us in the elevator, I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them.", "Well, I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry. Anyway, it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others, especially strangers.", "Sure, no matter what happened, they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way."]}
{"id": 1294, "dialog": ["Some companies use to ban dating among employees, but now they have realized it is something in avertable. People spend so much time at work. It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other.", "If we think positively, office love can be beneficial to company.", "Beneficial? I don't think so. If two employees get married, they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon, or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies. If they break up, the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable. By any means, the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating.", "But if two employees are in love, they will be happy. Happy people are more productive. If they develop an intimate relation with each other, they are willing to share knowledge and experience. It can help to improve work efficiency.", "I doubt that."]}
{"id": 1295, "dialog": ["How would you describe your relationship with our boss?", "We have a fairly good working relationship, but there was also a rough spot.", "What do you think his strengths are?", "Well, he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations."]}
{"id": 1296, "dialog": ["I am thinking about resigning from my current job.", "Have you thought about it seriously?", "Yes, I have been thinking about it for quite a while. Now I finally make up my mind to leave. I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday.", "Ok, did you find a new company?", "Yes, I will move on to XYZ Company.", "Good for you, but your leaving will be a great loss to us. It is so nice to work with you.", "Thanks. I had learned so much from you and our colleagues."]}
{"id": 1297, "dialog": ["What is the most enjoyable part about your job?", "I think meeting people. There are people from all over the country, all over the world, all walks of life which is the most interesting part of my job.", "What do you find annoying?", "Well, I work very long hours, ten hours a day is quite normal. And if something important comes up, I'm often in the office until 8 or 9 in the evening."]}
{"id": 1298, "dialog": ["Hello, this is Francis from XYZ Company. I would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week. Do you have time to meet?", "Well, I am not sure. Lets me check my agenda", "Ok.", "I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM, is it convenient for you?", "It is ok with me. So I will be arriving at your office around 2 fifteen PM. Do you have a projector in your room? I would like to show you some related charts", "Yes, there is. See you then."]}
{"id": 1299, "dialog": ["Can I ask for leave this afternoon?", "What is the problem?", "I had a headache this morning. I didn't pay attention to it. I thought probably it is because I didn't sleep well. But now it is getting worse and worse. I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive. Maybe it is the migrated.", "It is ok. You look really pale and red eyes. I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest.", "Thank you very much. I am sure good rest will do indeed. I don't have this too often."]}
{"id": 1300, "dialog": ["I would like to ask for one day off next week. Do you think the manager will agree? I know it is the busy time for our company, but I do have some important things to handle.", "Well, it is hard to say. At least you need to come up with a good reason.", "Actually, it is my mother's wedding. My parents divorced many years ago. Now she is ready to establish a new family. It is a special occasion. I've got to be there, right?", "Yes, you should be there. Go find the manager and ask. I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off. Don't forget to fill in the leave application form. It will be signed by the manager for approval.", "Thank you so much."]}
{"id": 1301, "dialog": ["You must be very busy these days. I heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time. It can be the most important meeting for our company this year.", "Sure it is. I am up to my ears as time expressed.", "Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time? You remember? I like that one.", "If we were in the same conference room, I would not work late these days. That conference room has been booked out. This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company. So everything has to be rearranged and checked, like tables, chairs, mean tacks, podium, audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu.", "Good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting. I am sure that your hard work will pay off."]}
{"id": 1302, "dialog": ["What sort of job would you like to take?", "I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator.", "We need an operator now.", "It's just the job I've been searching for."]}
{"id": 1303, "dialog": ["You must like negotiating a lot. People are saying, you are a super negotiator.", "Ha, I am flattered. Actually, when it comes to negotiate, you don't need to like it. You just need to understand how it works.", "I am not good at it by any means. Give me some advice.", "Well, generally speaking, if you want to change someone's mind or understand his position, you have to put yourself in his shoes. Understand his need and the cost for his need. And then you work together to find a solution.", "Sounds easy. But how can I apply to practice? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill. But I am afraid our boss will turn me down.", "Ok, as John after Kennedy put it, let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate."]}
{"id": 1304, "dialog": ["I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful. We just made a record sale this season.", "That is very encouraging news. I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research, they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month. That is to say, the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market.", "It is not an easy job. How do you like the advertisement for the new product?", "That is the best one I have seen. I am sure our target customers, young people will love it.", "Certainly."]}
{"id": 1305, "dialog": ["Here is the document you asked for this morning.", "Oh, you are so efficient. I thought you might give it to me tomorrow. Thanks.", "You're welcome. You know, these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination. The more I think about it, the more I hate myself for being so disorganized. I decided to change the situation as soon as possible. Otherwise I will be more regretful later.", "This is encouraging news, good for you! What is your solution, then?", "The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities. It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place.", "Sounds not bad! Better performance isn't just about doing a lot more. It is about focusing on the right things to do."]}
{"id": 1306, "dialog": ["Hi, Monica, congratulations! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech. And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project. You really made a big contribution to our company.", "Thank you, I just tried my best. I am very happy to know you like it.", "You must have been prepared for a long time. Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find, right?", "Well, yes. Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that. They are very supportive. I consulted an economic expert last week. He was very kind to give valuable suggestions.", "Now, the effort pays off. You have accomplished something.", "Come on, don't flatter me anymore. I took the job because I love being challenged. But I can't get this turned around without the support from you people."]}
{"id": 1307, "dialog": ["Do you want to sign for a Korea language class?", "What for? Oh, I see, you mean next year our company will expand business to the South Korea market.", "Right, we have located a business partner in Seoul. The first contact proves to be successful. The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month. I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon.", "Well, sounds promising. But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary. We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves.", "A slow sparrow should make an early start. You know, I am not quick at learning any language."]}

I am absolutely not a buyer at that price.", "I know it is not the cheapest on the market.

Every aspect has reached the international standard. It is a worthwhile investment.", "I understand that. If you can lower the price by 10 percent, we have a deal right now.", "Well, the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery.

It really worked well when I talked with each of them, explained my situation, and got their input.", "Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description?", "There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week.

I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations, which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done.", "What are your strengths and weaknesses?", "My strengths are my caring about getting the job done.

With Time Savings your money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time, but with Demand Savings your money is ' on demand ', you can withdraw at any time.", "I see. What's the interest like on those?", "There's quite a large difference. I mean, if you were to use demand deposit we could give you 0.13 % interest, but for a time deposit, of say, 1 year we would offer 0.82 %.", "Yes, I couldn't agree with you more. A 1 year time deposit it is!"]}

Please fill in this exchange form and show me your passport."]}
{"id": 2261, "dialog": ["Sir, are you alright? Just try to calm down, Sir. What's happened?", "I've lost my Traveller's Cheques, all of them.", "OK, just take a deep breath, Sir. Everything is going to be fine. Here's a form to report missing Traveller's Cheques, whatever the reason. Please fill it in and we can get moving on this.", "I see. You need the reference numbers? For each cheque?", "Yes, Sir. Do you have that information with you? At this bank, we always recommend our customers write down the reference number of each Traveller's Cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the Traveller's Cheques."]}
{"id": 2262, "dialog": ["May I help you?", "Yes, I'm going to Europe on business and I need to purchase some Traveller's Cheques.", "That's no problem. Which currency would you like to buy?", "I think Euros will be the best, as I'll only be in Mainland Europe.", "Of course. Do you have your passport with you? How much would you like to purchase?", "5,000 Euros will be sufficient, thanks.", "Please fill in this form. How would you like it? In 100 Euro cheques?", "That would be perfect, thank you."]}
{"id": 2263, "dialog": ["Hi, good to see you. What can we assist you with today? Going away on business again?", "Yes, I'm off again at the beginning of next week. I need to get some Traveller's Cheques.", "We do always recommend people take Traveller's Cheques when travelling overseas. The world is a dangerous place nowadays, you never know.", "Sure. At least if I do get robbed, heaven forbid, I can get my money back using the traveller's cheques insurance. Once, when I was travelling in France, I was pick-pocketed and not only did you replace my Traveller's Cheques for free, you also did it extremely quickly and easily."]}
{"id": 2264, "dialog": ["Good morning.", "Ah, hello. Do you have a service for buying Traveller's Cheques?", "Yes, we do. How can I help? I can give you a simple introduction, if you'd like?", "That would be wonderful.", "We usually recommend our clients buy US Dollar Traveller's Cheques, as they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world. They are certainly the most versatile.", "But what if something happened to them? What would happen to my money?", "As soon as you purchase your Traveller's Cheques from us, you are covered. No matter if you lose them or they are stolen, we will replace them promptly. All we ask is for you to write down the reference number of each cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the actual cheques. We will need that number if you need to make a claim.", "OK, I'd like to purchase 500 US dollars worth of Traveller's Cheques, please."]}
{"id": 2265, "dialog": ["Hello. What can I do for you?", "Hello. I'm here to get my salary.", "I see. Do you have your Current All-in-one Passbook with you? I'll need your password for this transaction.", "No problem.", "And how much of your salary would you like?", "I think just 3,000 RIB will be enough."]}

{"id": 2267, "dialog": ["Hey, Mr Brown. How are you? Look at that smile on your face!", "Recently it's been pretty good, actually.", "That's what we like to hear, a profitable business.", "Well, yes. Thanks, there's no trouble at the moment.", "So, what can I do for you today? Are you needing to withdraw or transfer?", "I'm going to need a Deposit Certification, to handle the affairs related to home.", "Oh, domestic things? Yes, of course, we can help you with that."]}
{"id": 2268, "dialog": ["Hi, can I assist you in any way?", "Oh, thank you. Yes, please. What I need is to handle some domestic affairs.", "Oh, I see. In what area?", "Well, I need a Deposit Certification to handle this.", "Yes, we have this service. Have you got a deposit certificate and your passport? I'm sorry to ask you, but your passport is very important.", "Yes, yes. Here it is. By the way, is there a handling fee?", "Yes, I'm afraid there is."]}
{"id": 2269, "dialog": ["Today, you need to pay 20 RIB in handling fees.", "Can't you just take it from my account? I can't be bothered with cash dealings today.", "I must tell you that because your banking has been such a large amount, you need to wait until you leave the country to get any currency back.", "You mean, if there is any left over?", "Yes, totally. It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system.", "Right, so the deposit, if I don't draw on it will be blocked after you get the Deposit Certification?", "That's right. I know we have a complex system, but you have caught on so quickly."]}
{"id": 2270, "dialog": ["Hello, Sir. We haven't seen you for quite a while. So, what is it today that we can do for you?", "I need a Deposit Certificate to handle some stuff in land.", "I see, yes, I can do that now. I'm sure you know, as I may have told you before, you should pay an extra 20 RIB handling fee for this service.", "Yes, I recalled you charging that before. And I thought it was extortionate! Haha!", "I can just take it from your account, you don't need to give me cash.", "OK... so it'll come out of my account? Well, that makes it much easier.", "Anything else you'll be needing today, Sir?", "Nope. That's everything, thanks."]}
{"id": 2271, "dialog": ["Good morning, Madam. What can I do for you?", "I need to have some money transferred from the UK, from my company. It's kind of an emergency.", "That shouldn't be a problem, Madam. I'm sure we can sort this out for you quickly.", "That would be wonderful. The problem is I don't have an account with you. That is a problem, isn't it?", "Well, to be honest, it will slow things down a little. But it's not a big problem. You can do it by T / T.", "T / T? What on earth is that!? Sorry, but I've never heard of it. T / T?", "It means ' telegraphic transfer '. So, if you use this way it's fast and secure and can be done from anywhere, to anywhere in the world."]}
{"id": 2272, "dialog": ["Welcome. How can we be of service today?", "Hello. My aunt in the US has sent me $ 500. She sent it yesterday, using the standard service. It's my birthday today, you see.", "Well, happy birthday. If it was sent yesterday using the usual service, it should be here already. You do have an account with us, right?", "Yes. Here's my card. Do you need my ID?", "Please. Just to double check all the details.", "There you go."]}
{"id": 2273, "dialog": ["IBA Bank, Business Banking Department. Ling Ming speaking. How may I help you?", "Ms Ling! It's Mr Gwent, from Montgomery Computers.", "Hello, Mr Gwent. What can I do for you today?", "Some money has been sent from our Head Office in Berlin. Could you check whether you have received the remittance yet?", "Of course. Do you know which bank it was sent through and the amount and currency?", "Deutsche Bank. It was 25,000 US dollars.", "Yes, here it is. That's received and cleared, so it's available for withdrawal."]}
{"id": 2274, "dialog": ["Hello, again. Did you discuss everything with your colleagues?", "Yes, yes. It seems that everything is settled.", "Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid?", "We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts, whether they are currently with this bank or not.", "That's not a problem.", "Of course, if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank, or open new accounts with you.", "Thank you very much. We always welcome new customers."]}
{"id": 2275, "dialog": ["Hello, Sir. What can I do for you today?", "I need to find a new way of getting my insurance.", "We've just started a new business at this bank, Bank-Insurance Link.", "Could you give me some details about that?", "Certainly. It could really benefit someone like you. Besides insurance for you, you can also get more or less dividends from the insurance company.", "That sounds great. More dividends if I want to purchase them!", "There are two different types that we are offering at the moment, Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit.", "I'll go through the materials that you have given me and return shortly. Thanks."]}
{"id": 2276, "dialog": ["Hello, Sir. So, you are back?", "Yes, hello again. I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit.", "That's pretty easy to explain. With the Deposit, the interest is fixed, but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year. The longer the term, the higher the Dividend you earn. This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate.", "And I can purchase that here?", "Yes. And if you already have a Current Account with us, the Insurance Premium can be paid through it, which saves all of us a lot of hassle."]}
{"id": 2277, "dialog": ["Hi there. How can I help?", "I started a new job last month and I'm expecting my first salary.", "I see. And your company has a Wage Distribution Service Agreement with us?", "So I was told, yes. They gave me this book?", "Yes, that's a Current-all-in-one Passbook. That's what you need to get your salary."]}
{"id": 2278, "dialog": ["Good day, Madam. What service do you require today?", "I'd like some info about your Payroll Services, please.", "It's possible to sign an agreement with us, and then we can pay your staff directly. That is called an Entrustment Agreement.", "I see. How is it paid? I mean, what payment methods are possible?", "We can transfer the funds each month, at your request, into each employee's account. It is possible to pay in cash or to pay directly to the employee's savings account, no matter which bank they do business with.", "That sounds pretty good. Tell me, must we use the same payment method for all of our employees?", "Not at all. We can adjust the payment methods depending on the requirement of each employee.", "That sounds just perfect. I'll talk things over with some colleagues and get back to you. Thank you very much for the information."]}
{"id": 2279, "dialog": ["You've decided that you definitely want to purchase this particular one?", "To be honest, I haven't really done much research.", "I would recommend that you at least glance through these brochures, just to make sure that you have selected the right policy for you. Take your time, Sir.", "Thanks for your advice, after going through all of these materials I've decided not to go with my initial choice.", "Of course, Sir. If I could have your details again and your ID, I'll check them and we can go on."]}

You can transfer the money you have in your account into your Fund Account.", "How can I do that?", "You can use your Deposit Book or your Credit Card. And of course, you can use our e-banking."]}

{"id": 2282, "dialog": ["Good day to you. How can we assist you today?", "Hello, yes, can I do Bank-Insurance Link business here?", "Yes, you can. The best way is to first select the company you want to buy from, then we can help you to do it. Do you have a Current Account here?", "Yes. Is that necessary?", "Well, it certainly makes everything easier, both at this end and at your end.", "OK. Here's my account details."]}
{"id": 2283, "dialog": ["Good afternoon, how can I help?", "Hi there. I'd like to draw some cash from my Fund Account at the Securities Company. Could I check my balance before I withdraw anything?", "Of course. Your balance is 92,320 RIB in your Securities Account. How much would you like to withdraw?", "I'd like 20,000 RIB, please. If that's possible.", "No problem. Please fill in this transfer form that will authorise us to send the amount from the Securities Company to your account."]}
{"id": 2284, "dialog": ["Hello again. Have you come to a decision?", "I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates. What's the real difference, except the amounts available?", "Visible Certificates are registered and the holders of these can report any loss directly to the bank. Also, they can be cashed in advance, before the maturity is up.", "Right. How about the Bearer Certificates? Can they be cashed before the maturity date?", "Unfortunately, not. You see, because they are not registered, they can be bought and sold by anyone. They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution.", "So, if I was strapped for cash, I could transfer it to get some money?", "Technically, yes.", "OK, I think I've got it."]}
{"id": 2285, "dialog": ["How can I help you today?", "I want to sign up for some funds units. How do I go about it?", "Have you got some ID and your cash card?", "Yes. I've already got a fund account with you too.", "How many more fund units would you like to purchase today?", "I'm not quite sure. You see, I already have more than 5,000 RIB in my cash card, but I really don't know how much I should get.", "The usual minimum purchase is 5,000 RIB.", "That settles it then. 5,000 RIB it is, thanks."]}
{"id": 2286, "dialog": ["Good afternoon. Can I be of service?", "I don't know. Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter?", "Yes, of course. We have Treasury Notes with two, three and five-year terms available.", "Two years is fine, with a value of 1,000 RIB.", "OK, could I take a look at some ID please, like a passport?", "Here you go. By the way, is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up?", "No, I'm afraid that isn't possible. You must wait until maturity before you cash them."]}
{"id": 2287, "dialog": ["What can I do for you?", "Hello, there. I've just started using your net banking and I'm looking for some information about my Commission Fund.", "I see. The Fund Trading System of our Net Banking deals with both trading and information. If you use this system, you can subscribe for and apply to buy other funds.

With our Net Banking, anything is possible!"]}
{"id": 2288, "dialog": ["Hello, Madam. What can I do for you today?", "Hello. Yes, I'm here to redeem a Treasury Note. It's not at the maturity date yet, but it is an emergency.", "OK, can I see the note and some ID, please?", "There you are. As you can see, the maturity isn't up yet.", "You do realise that you must pay a 0.2 % charge for premature cancellation, right?", "Oh, really? No, I wasn't aware of that.", "Unfortunately, yes. You see, this is a three-year note ; it was issued over a year ago, but not over two years. So, you will have to pay. I'm sorry about that."]}
{"id": 2289, "dialog": ["Hello there, Sir. I've dealt with you before, haven't I?", "You remember me! Yes, I'm with Li Wang Enterprises ; I'm the Accountant Peters.", "Yes, of course, Mr Peters! Good to see you again. What can we do for you today?", "Well, we've just acquired a new business so we need to set up a lot of services with you. We are particularly interested in Agent Services.", "I see. We offer Agent Services free of charge here. Before your new business begins trading, we could, on behalf of your existing company, do a series of registration and get the certificates you need. If you are unsure of the local laws, that is."]}
{"id": 2290, "dialog": ["Do you have any questions before you commit yourself to this?", "Actually, yes I do. I was wondering about the subscription fee. And how much will you charge me during the time of redeeming this new fund?", "The subscription fee is charged at a rate of 1.2 %. But for redeeming, a rate of a usual 0.5 %, we shall charge you 1.6 % if you apply to buy it after the fund-raising period.", "So, it's going to cost me then?", "I'm afraid so, yes.

We also need the Loan Certificate as well. Do you have that?", "A copy or the original? I guess you need the original, right? OK, I'll return shortly."]}
{"id": 2312, "dialog": ["The ATM machine outside won't give me back my card.", "Let's go take a look at it. Do you have your ID with you?", "Yes, here it is.", "Okay, I see the problem. You forgot your code, didn't you?", "How did you know?", "The machine gives you three attempts to enter the correct code and after that it assumes that you are not the real owner and confiscates it.", "Oh. But can I have my card back now?", "Yes, I can get it for you but I need to go back inside the bank."]}
{"id": 2313, "dialog": ["Mr Ludlow, hello. It's good to see you again. What can we do for you today?", "Hello, I'm sorry it's been such a long time. I've been away on business. I'd like to discount this.", "No problem. Could I please see the bill and all of the other documents?", "Yeah, sure. Here they are. Take your time going through them, I'm in no hurry.", "There's no problem here, everything's in order. I can transact that for you now.", "Do I need to pay anything? Like a handling fee, or something?", "No, you don't need to pay anything on top. We just simply deduct the discounting interest."]}
{"id": 2314, "dialog": ["I would like to open a checking account at this branch.", "Do you have any other accounts with this bank?", "I do, at a different location, I have a savings account and a CD.", "In that case, we will need to fill out this paperwork. Do you have identification with you?", "Here is my driver's license. Will that work?", "Yes. Do you know what type of checking account you would like to open, business or personal?", "Business please. And I want the most simple one you have.", "Then you would like the ' no frills ' business account."]}
{"id": 2315, "dialog": ["Hello, back already? That was quick!", "Yes, luckily our office is just down the street.", "Great. I shall also need a copy of your own ID and the Warrant Letter, you can fill in one here.", "Oh, I see.", "Next time, you can get one from the counter over there. Or before you come in, you can download one from our website. It's really easy."]}
{"id": 2316, "dialog": ["Hello, is everything alright? Can I help?", "I have a Promissory Note, but it's not called that. It's a Bill of Exchange.", "Similar to a Promissory Note, yes. I can deal with that for you right here. The difference between a Promissory Note and a Bill of Exchange is that this product is transferable and can bind one party to pay a third party that was not involved in its creation.", "So, even if someone wasn't directly involved, they can become involved? Like the bank you cash it in?", "That's right. We didn't issue it to you, but technically we are buying it from you. So, we become involved.", "I see. Sorry about this, I'm new in this job and I've never even seen one of these before! My boss just told me to come here and sort it out.", "As long as you have all of the documentation we require you have nothing to worry about."]}
{"id": 2317, "dialog": ["Is there anything else, apart from the Credit Rating and Debt to Asset Ratio?", "There is the Balance of Net Liabilities. This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years.", "Right, OK. That, again, shouldn't be a problem.", "And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average, for that particular industry, for the first two quarters of the year.", "Well, as far as I can tell, we qualify.", "Of course we will need proof, originals and duplicate of everything. As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it, it should be very quick indeed."]}
{"id": 2318, "dialog": ["What can I do for you, Madam?", "Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting?", "Certainly, Madam. What would you like to know?", "Well, everything really.", "All right. We can grant a Financing Promise Quota, if you qualify. This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way. Firstly, your Credit Rating must be class A, and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch, for the industry you are involved in."]}
{"id": 2319, "dialog": ["Good afternoon, Sir. You're here to see about a Temporary Loan, right? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets. Is that what you require?", "Yes, that's exactly what I need. How about terms for these?", "Well, we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans. The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period.", "Is there any flexibility on that?", "Unfortunately, not.", "OK. In my position, I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan. That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan.", "Not a problem, Sir. If you'd just fill out these forms, and of course with necessary clearance, we can get you the money right away."]}
{"id": 2320, "dialog": ["Hello. I'm Duty Manager today ; you wanted to speak to me?", "Yes. I hope you can help. I'm interested in obtaining a Working Capital Loan.

Tell me, do you have a Basic Account with us?", "Yes. I also have a Loan Certificate.", "Oh, that's good. We will come to our final decision based on your credit rating, the payment capability...", "Well, we have no problems with our credit rating, I can assure you."]}
{"id": 2322, "dialog": ["Hi there. Welcome to Lincoln Corporate Services. How can we help?", "Hi. I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans?", "Yes, we do. You'll go through the acceptance application, then a first review, then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval. Why don't you read through this brochure? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan, the terms and conditions, etc.", "That's a good idea, to familiarise myself with it. Then, I'll be back if we decide to go ahead."]}
{"id": 2323, "dialog": ["Welcome to IBA. What can we do for you?", "It's a bit of a problem situation, actually... you see, our company has a Corporate Account with you, but unfortunately, we've been experiencing cash flow problems recently.", "I'm sorry to hear that. We value all of our customers, regardless of circumstances. What can we do to help?", "We are going to need a loan. I'm not sure what loan is suitable for us, though.", "If you think it will be very short-term, I would recommend you go with the 60 - day loan. Then it can be paid back quicker, so you won't have to consider it in the future.", "That seems like a good idea, it's for wages, you see."]}
{"id": 2324, "dialog": ["Mr Brown! How nice to see you, can I help?", "I'm not exactly sure if it's your department, but I'd like to ask some questions about qualifying for Comprehensive Credit Granting.", "I see. You are one of my favourite customers, Mr Brown. I'm more than happy to help. For Comprehensive Credit Granting, IBA will grant a promised quota for you, that is, if you qualify. Of course, your credit record, within you field of trade needs to be up to scratch.", "How long a period will you look at to determine this?", "We will consider the first part of the year, in your particular field, and your credit rating can be no less than class A, during that period.", "That sounds simple enough. It's Friday today, I'll be back on Monday morning, first thing, with all of the relevant data. See you then, and enjoy your weekend."]}
{"id": 2325, "dialog": ["Hello. How can we be of service?", "I'm here to see about a Fixed Asset Loan.", "OK, are you already an account holder?", "Yes, I am. But I'm not sure if I'm eligible.", "To find out if you are eligible for our Fixed Asset Loan, we will have to look at various aspects of your business, such as your long-term business prospects, your cash flow, your profitability, your capital structure...", "For my credit worthiness?", "Yes, and then other qualitative factors, such as the transparency of your business operations, your credibility and the integrity of your management."]}
{"id": 2326, "dialog": ["Welcome to IBA. Can I help you?", "Yes, hello. Our company used your bank to send some documents to Malaysia last week. Could you check and see if the proceeds have come back yet, please? It's Sang Hung Enterprises, based in Kula Lump.", "OK, just a moment... yes, it has arrived. The amount is 51,998 US dollars net, 12 US dollars has been deducted by the intermediary bank.", "That's as it should be. When will it be paid in and credited to our account?", "It's already credited to your account."]}
{"id": 2327, "dialog": ["Hello, Fife Computers. How can I help?", "Hello, this is the Corporate Department of Lincoln Bank calling. We are calling to let you know that some documents have arrived for you at our bank.", "Oh, really? Do you know which company they are from?", "They're from Schnitt's of Rudesheim, Germany. Would you like us to check them?", "What's the charge for that?", "It's 150 RIB for the service.", "That seems pretty reasonable. Thanks."]}
{"id": 2328, "dialog": ["Good day. How can we assist you?", "I need to get a Letter of Credit. Is this the right window?", "It certainly is. Do you have your contract and Import License?", "Yes, right here in my brief case. Just a moment, please.", "Thanks. What you need to do now is deposit 100 % of the guaranteed funds of your contract into your account with us.", "That's done. There is more than enough to cover the contract amount in our account.", "That's great. We will have to charge you 250 RIB for that service, though. Could you please fill in this? Thanks."]}
{"id": 2329, "dialog": ["Next, please.", "Could I purchase Euro with RIB here?

Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone.", "Well, could you change them too? The dollars, I want to change them into Swiss francs.", "OK, wait for a moment. Well, I am sorry, but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins. In this case, you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs.", "It doesn't matter.", "Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo.", "Thanks a lot. Good-bye."]}
{"id": 2330, "dialog": ["Good afternoon, Mr Meng! It's nice to see you today. It's been a while, hasn't it?", "Hello, Miao Ping. Yes, it has.

Would you please give me some advice?", "Certainly, I'll be very happy to help you.

You just need to present your deposit book.", "Thank you for your help. I think I'll open a current account.", "OK. Do you have your ID card on you?", "Yes.", "Good. Everything is done.

Down here, at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount.", "I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later. Thanks, bye for now."]}
{"id": 2333, "dialog": ["Hello, Sir. What can we do for you today?", "Hello. I've been asked to come and see about something called L / C? What is it exactly?", "L / C stands for ' letter of credit '. This is necessary for trade between two countries. A Letter of Credit is quite literally that \u2014 a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer, the buyer, and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default. Nowadays, it's sometimes used for domestic trade too.", "So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street!"]}

I would like an outline of responsibilities, both ours, yours and the beneficiary, please.", "OK, to start, the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms, Way Bills, Bills of Lading, Customs forms, various certificates.", "OK, got it. Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead?", "Just that in effect, a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank, the bank's customer, and the beneficiary, and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds.", "That sounds fine, thanks for that. Let's go ahead!"]}
{"id": 2335, "dialog": ["Hello. Is everything OK, there?", "I'm having a little trouble with this form.", "What seems to be the problem?", "There are two types of L / C here and I'm not sure which one I want.", "That's right, there's ' revocable ' and ' irrevocable '. We usually go for the irrevocable one, it's the most popular.", "So, I should choose that one?", "I would recommend it, yes. Then you just need to complete that form.", "I see. It's very nice of you to help me. Is this form alright?", "Yes, that's all in order. Let's get this processed for you, then."]}

Have you checked everything carefully?", "Very carefully, that's when I found the problem.", "Ah, I see. The goods description is totally different from what you are expecting, right?", "Yep, you've got it! What should we do?", "Usually, if the problem is insignificant I advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that. But this does seem a little more serious. I suggest you get back on to them right now and ask them about it. Hopefully you can sort it out over the phone.", "That's a great idea ; thanks for your help."]}

Ah, I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction.

Good or bad?", "It's not too bad today, actually. 828.23."]}
{"id": 2339, "dialog": ["Hello, welcome to the International Business Counter, Sir. What can we do for you today?", "Hi. I need some help with these documents under L / C.", "Of course.

It's been delayed quite significantly and my manager is unwilling to accept it.", "You will need to return the documents. That's no problem ; we can deal with that for you now.", "Thank you. I need to get this done as soon as possible ; my manager is tearing his hair out!"]}
{"id": 2340, "dialog": ["Good afternoon. Welcome to Lincoln Bank, how can we be of service?", "Hi. You called and said I should come in. It's about some documents that have arrived for Nobut Foods.", "Just pulling up your information now. Yes, some documents arrived for you from Sapporo.", "Oh great! We've been waiting for those. Is everything alright with them?", "Actually, there is a problem. It's the goods description, it's a little different on the invoice, but this does happen sometimes.", "No, everything has to be perfect.", "No problem, I'll just get the form for you."]}
{"id": 2341, "dialog": ["Hello again. What can I do for you today?", "Yes, I'm back! It's nice to see you again. I'm here about those documents.", "Ah yes, the ones from Sapporo we were dealing with yesterday?", "That's right. I had a phone call asking me to come back in, about rejecting them?", "Well, we were contacted by your manager and he said...", "Yes, we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee.", "The customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a Discrepancy Fee of 100 US dollars.", "That's wonderful news! I'm glad we decided to rethink our actions ; it's all turned out for the best this way. Thank you for helping us to fix that little problem."]}
{"id": 2342, "dialog": ["Good morning, Mr Bell. How are you today? Are you here to sort out your L / C documents?", "Yes. I've been through them and there's a problem, a rather major discrepancy actually. You see? It should be KN509.", "I see, here it says KM509.", "Exactly, if we accept these it could cause a lot of problems in our record and our accounts system because the numbers don't match.", "Yes, I see what you mean. You need to reject these documents."]}
{"id": 2343, "dialog": ["Welcome to IBA. How can I help you?", "You called yesterday to tell me that our funds under the L / C had arrived? It's Ming Cha Legal Services.", "Oh, yes. I remember. You must be Mr Xie. It's nice to put a face to a voice.", "Yes, it sure is. The L / C number is JD185649000023.", "JD185649000023? Yes, found it. 175,000 Euros, is that correct? JD185649000023?", "Correct. Could I convert that into RIB?", "Yes, you can. Just wait a moment and I'll do that for you now.", "That's fine, thanks."]}
{"id": 2344, "dialog": ["Good morning, Sir. Are you here to get some advice about our new Personal Financing Program?", "I am indeed. What can you tell me?", "The account is a compound savings account, which is in RIB and Forex.", "Do I get a card?", "Yes, you can have a Money Link card. You can also base the account on time deposits. The choice is yours.", "How about the interest? I'm not really happy with the interest I'm receiving through my Current Account.", "The interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our Personal Financing.", "That sounds better. Also, can I use the one card for several accounts? Say, if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other?", "Yes, you can have multi-accounts on the card, you can also make transfers from the account and securities companies and various other benefits.", "That's wonderful."]}
{"id": 2345, "dialog": ["Hello, there. What can we do for you today?", "I received some leaflets in the post from you, one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies.

We have just introduced the program, but it's very popular already.", "I also read that if the customer is a stock investor, which I am, it's possible to get additional benefits?", "Right again. We can provide a tailored consultation service for you, giving you the latest quotes from the Stock Exchange and help you to plan what exactly you do with your investments.", "What if I don't want to come in to the branch, can I use the consultation service over the phone?", "Certainly, Sir. Via phone or Internet, any time, any place."]}
{"id": 2346, "dialog": ["Good afternoon, you look a little stuck.

What is it exactly that you are interested in?", "I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit.", "Well, that all depends on how much you want to invest.", "I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB.", "That's a nice round figure to deal with! OK, if you were to buy this insurance policy, your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB.", "And for the Savings Deposit?", "For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more. You see, in time deposit, the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax. So, technically you could get more than a third more.", "Wow! A third more? Very good."]}
{"id": 2347, "dialog": ["Good day. Welcome to IBA, what can I assist you with today?", "Hello, yes, I'm a stock investor and I'm looking at opening a new account with you. Perhaps your new compound savings one?

I mean, some days I buy and sell quite a lot. Some days, there's no activity at all.", "For every transaction you make, a statement will be drawn up and can be posted to you or sent via e-mail, or if you want to be double sure we can do both.", "That's just what I need, sometimes I'm pretty forgetful."]}

In that case, could I have the number of the Service Centre please?", "Of course. It's 33234. That will put you in touch with a Personal Banker.", "And they can deal with everything?", "That's the beauty of the service ; they can deal with everything, with total security.", "That's good to know.

What about free delivery? If we make a large enough order, could you waive the deliver fee?", "Yes, our delivery fee could be waived, if you make an order of 50 units or more. We would have to insist on the annual contract, however. I understand it's not the most convenient for you.

They reached us two weeks ago, and were immediately examined after they arrived. To our astonishment, about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms. We can't accept them in this state.

What's more, your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage.", "The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags, sixty of these bags to a carton. It is stated on the surveyor? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact. So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing.", "As you know, before shipment, the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question. They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export.", "I think the Inspection Bureau at your end, when effecting inspection, only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard. The part that was not dried properly, most probably, escaped their attention. As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment, I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss.", "The inspection certificate, which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand, is considered final and binding upon both parties. We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit, because you bought the goods F. O. B. Houston and on shipping quality, not on landed quality. Your claim, in our opinion, should be referred to the insurance company, as the mishap occurred after shipment.", "We've already got in touch with the underwriter. But they have refused to accept any liability. They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage.", "That's a matter over which we could exercise no control, then. I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement, that is, if you have covered this risk in your coverage.", "To my regret, we failed to cover contamination. This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us.", "Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case.", "Well, live and learn. It seems we'll have to waive the claim."]}

The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere.", "I'm afraid I can't agree with you there. I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we'Ve received from other sources.", "But you must take the quality into consideration. Everyone in the trade knows that US's bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries.", "I agree that yours are of better quality. But there's competition from synthetic products, too. You can't very well ignore that. Prices for synthetic bristles haven't changed much over the years.", "There's practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses. That's why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones. To be frank with you, if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us, we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price.", "Well, we'll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price.

They're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.", "Mmmm, sounds interesting... gourmet chocolates, where are they produced? Belgium?", "Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.", "Really? I didn't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production", "That's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. They'Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one!", "Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth...", "Unique, aren't they? I bet you'Ve never tasted anything like it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the creme make it through inspection.", "Yes, very interesting flavors... Slightly spicy, very unique, that's for sure. Exactly what ARE the ingredients?", "I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations. I'm sure you can keep a secret. Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and Haggis.", "Haggis? What's Haggis?", "It's a traditional Scottish delicacy, you take sheep's liver, heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep's stomach.", "Ah, get back to you.", "Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson?"]}

It can't possibly be that expansive!", "It is, I'll tell you why. We'll have to call in the electrician, he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM, and it will probably take him an hour a light. Plus, the halogen lights take more electricity, so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well.", "Can't you give me a break on this? We've already spent so much money on lighting, I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens.", "No, that's the cost, and that's what it's going to cost us. We can't go in the hole with this.

If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning, we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement.", "Firstly, we'd like to discuss a discounted price. If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders, we can pay in 60 days.", "Huh... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do. How about this? We'll give you a discount of 4 %, but you can have 90 days credits.", "Well, that might be acceptable, if you handle the insurance fees.", "No, you have to take care of the insurance.

If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf, the dampness or rain may get into them. This would make the blouses spotted or ruined.", "No need to worry about that.

Besides, cartons are easy to cut open, and this increases the risk of pilferage.", "Tampering with cartons is easily detected. I should say that this rather discourages pilferage.", "Maybe so, but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage, the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing, or packing unsuitable for sea voyage.", "But cartons are quite seaworthy.

Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.", "That's interesting and logical I guess.

How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network? You may choose either one as port of shipment. It makes no difference to us. There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York.", "It sounds all right to me, but I will have to think about it. I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow.
